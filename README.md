# synaptic_plasticity_project
_Project for the course "Modelling Synaptic Plasticity", Summer Semester of 2024, University of Osnabr√ºck_

## Overview
main.py runs all combinations of encoding/decoding schemes specified in the respective lists.
Remember to start tensorboard to track training/test performance.

## (Preliminary) Goals
To build a Gymnasium-Based RL experiment that actually learns something, and to compare performance of different encoding/decoding schemes for the network.

## To be added to this readme:
How to install, how to use, what this is, known issues.
